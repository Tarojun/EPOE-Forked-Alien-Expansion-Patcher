Patch types: Expansion, surgery expansion, repair, vanilla repair

Expansions:
- Added advanced stabilizer tail. No movement penalty, small improvement to dodge chance.
- Able to restore cosmetic body part on ATK_AnthromorphTail.

Repair:
- Stabilizer tail parentName adjusted to "BodyPartBionicBase".

Vanilla repair:
- "Tail" body part is a vanilla def used by animals, being overwritten by this race mod.
Added the vanilla version back by forced overwrite to repair it, as this mod is loaded after the race mods.
- Added new ATK_AnthromorphTail, and now uses this body part in place of the "Tail" body part.
